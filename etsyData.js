The design is permanently etched into the glass.\n\nCAN I CHANGE THE BIRTH DATE OR YEAR ON A BIRTHDAY GLASS YOU HAVE LISTED?\nYes! Our designs are all able to be customized to meet your specific needs. Please just make a note in the notes to seller section during checkout to change a year or age on a birthday glass.

Your ring will have a similar look to those in the pictures - charred oak wood - but each ring is a unique piece of wood with it&#39;s own unique patterning with no two exactly alike!  Please note the variability in coloring in the photos - due to the charring process, your ring may be lighter or darker than the first image!\n\nThis is the charred wood option for this ring - if you&#39;d prefer a lighter ring, check out my natural version here: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/278011450\/\n\nAfter a Jack Daniels barrel is no longer of use to the distillery, it is sold to a number of craftsmen who make everything from planters to knife handles from the wood - or, in this case, a solid wood ring.   I purchase the barrels straight from the distillery general store and have them shipped to my doorstep, where I dismantle them into individual staves to be cut into rings.\n  \n\nEach ring is hand polished and finished with several layers of cyanoacrylate.  While many crafters use oils and waxes to finish their rings, cyanoacrylate provides a stronger bond within the wood grain, provides protection from water, and reduces the likelihood of scratching - a common issue with other finishing materials.\n\nTo order a pair of rings:  add the first ring to your cart with the correct size\/shape information, return to this page, then add another ring with the second size\/shape information.\n\nDimensions:\nRing Size:  5-13.  If you need a larger or smaller size, please inquire using the &quot;Ask a Question&quot; button in the Cart area of the page.\nWidth:  5mm-9mm\nShape:  Rounded or flat profile.  Most people find that the rounded profile is more comfortable during the initial phase of getting used to wearing your ring, but this is largely an aesthetic choice.\n\nProcessing times:  Processing times change depending on my current backlog.  Please see the shop announcement on my homepage for current times to ship!\n\nAs with all wood rings, this material is less durable than a traditional metal ring, but with proper care and maintenance, it will look beautiful and last for years!\n\nSize exchanges:  We offer the first size exchange free for residents of the United States (return shipping of the original is your responsibility).  Further alterations to size will incur an additional fee to cover the cost of shipping and handling.","creation_tsz":1486656973,"ending_tsz":1497021373,"original_creation_tsz":1448636802,"last_modified_tsz":1486656973,"price":"50.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":975,"tags":["Mens Wedding Band","Engagement Ring","Womens Ring","Couples Rings","Wood Ring","Wood Anniversary","Tennessee Whiskey","Whiskey Barrel Ring","Reclaimed Wood","Wooden Ring","American Oak Wood","Wooden Jewelry","Wood Wedding Ring"],"category_path":["Jewelry","Ring"],"category_path_ids":[68887482,69152047],"materials":["whiskey barrel"],"shop_section_id":19248734,"featured_rank":1,"state_tsz":1484798589,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/258181398\/tennessee-whiskey-barrel-wood-ring?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":50395,"num_favorers":4180,"shipping_template_id":22716839096,"processing_min":5,"processing_max":10,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"3","item_weight_units":null,"item_length":"2","item_width":"2","item_height":"1","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1232,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Rings","Bands"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":890819888,"hex_code":"8D8078","red":141,"green":128,"blue":120,"hue":23,"saturation":14,"brightness":55,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1450468212,"listing_id":258181398,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/11484887\/il_75x75.890819888_ewsk.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/11484887\/il_170x135.890819888_ewsk.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/11484887\/il_570xN.890819888_ewsk.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/11484887\/il_fullxfull.890819888_ewsk.jpg","full_height":640,"full_width":800},{"listing_image_id":952405166,"hex_code":"6F5741","red":111,"green":87,"blue":65,"hue":29,"saturation":41,"brightness":43,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1459817834,"listing_id":258181398,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/11484887\/il_75x75.952405166_eg38.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/11484887\/il_170x135.952405166_eg38.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/11484887\/il_570xN.952405166_eg38.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/11484887\/il_fullxfull.952405166_eg38.jpg","full_height":800,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":952405330,"hex_code":"503D2B","red":80,"green":61,"blue":43,"hue":29,"saturation":46,"brightness":31,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1459817834,"listing_id":258181398,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/11484887\/il_75x75.952405330_apo2.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/11484887\/il_170x135.952405330_apo2.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/11484887\/il_570xN.952405330_apo2.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/11484887\/il_fullxfull.952405330_apo2.jpg","full_height":667,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":890579399,"hex_code":"91683E","red":145,"green":104,"blue":62,"hue":30,"saturation":57,"brightness":56,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1450468212,"listing_id":258181398,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/11484887\/il_75x75.890579399_cuvp.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/11484887\/il_170x135.890579399_cuvp.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/11484887\/il_570xN.890579399_cuvp.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/11484887\/il_fullxfull.890579399_cuvp.jpg","full_height":640,"full_width":800},{"listing_image_id":898959456,"hex_code":"673C18","red":103,"green":60,"blue":24,"hue":27,"saturation":76,"brightness":40,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452115874,"listing_id":258181398,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/11484887\/il_75x75.898959456_rqhe.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/11484887\/il_170x135.898959456_rqhe.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/11484887\/il_570xN.898959456_rqhe.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/11484887\/il_fullxfull.898959456_rqhe.jpg","full_height":667,"full_width":1000}],"Shop":{"shop_id":11484887,"shop_name":"HawkinsHandicrafts","user_id":70492310,"creation_tsz":1439844033,"title":"Handcrafted Wood Rings","announcement":"Thanks for visiting the shop!

I make custom wood and acrylic rings and cedar hanging baskets and containers from my home workshop.  My business started when I needed hanging baskets for my orchids and bromeliads - building unique containers for my own enjoyment and, eventually, selling to local businesses.  Over time, I began experimenting with other projects and really enjoyed making rings, which has led to the diversity of wood and acrylic rings offered in m Etsy shop today.\r\n\r\nI aim to satisfy my customers.  If you have need of a custom design, I&#39;m interested in making it a reality for you.  If you are, for any reason, dissatisfied with my product, please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me so that I can remedy the situation.  If you have other questions, I&#39;ve listed some of the most frequently asked below, or feel free to send me a message.\r\n\r\nThanks again for shopping at Hawkins Handicrafts!","policy_payment":"SECURE OPTIONS\nEtsy keeps your payment information secure.

Charges vary depending on the length of the engraving and are subject to the terms of customized orders.  Contact me for further details or to set up a custom listing to do engraving work.\n\nSIZING DETAILS\nSizes are in standard US ring sizes.  The first exchange for sizing is free for US buyers.  Non-US buyers must pay additional shipping charges for exchanges due to sizing.\n\nIf you are unsure of your ring size, it is recommended to have your finger sized by a jeweler, or to try an online ring sizing guide such as findmyringsize.com\n\nCARE INSTRUCTIONS\nAvoid using acetone-based cleaners like nail polish remover as this will destroy the ring&#39;s finish.  Clean with a wet cloth or paper towel.\n\nThe finish on your wood ring may eventually scratch and need repair.  While it may sound intimidating, this process is very easy and only requires a few supplies - liquid superglue, paper towels, and sand paper or polishing grits.  For detailed step-by-step instructions, please send me a message and I would be happy to provide them!\n\nGIFT WRAPPING AND PACKAGING\nRings are placed inside of a small AMAC (transparent plastic) jewelry box (bamboo rings come in a sustainably produced cardboard box) lined with cotton.  Orders are sent with a receipt-style packing slip using 100% recycled paper inside of a brown cushioned mailing envelope made from recycled newspaper.  If you are sending this as a gift and prefer not to have the purchase details in the package, please indicate this at time of purchase.  We do not offer additional gift wrapping at this time.\n\nRETURNS\nContact must be made with me prior to returns to ensure any issues are handled prior to shipping and to alert me to look for a package.  Returned rings should be placed inside their original jewelry box and then placed into a cushioned mailing envelope (available in the shipping supplies at your local post office).  Shipping may be done via USPS First Class for locations within the US to provide a cheap option that still provides tracking information.  Canada residents are strongly encouraged to utilize shipping with tracking and insurance for your protection in the case of a lost or stolen package.\n\nDAMAGED OR LOST ITEMS DURING SHIPPING\nPlease contact me immediately if you suspect a package has been lost or misdelivered.  Make certain that you&#39;ve checked with family members and neighbors, and looked in likely spots where a package may have been left.  Call your local post office in the case of a misdelivery so that they can track down your package and correct the delivery.\n\nIf your item has been damaged during shipping, you must keep both the damaged item and packaging, be willing to take photos of the damage, and fill out forms from our insurer in order to process your replacement\/refund in a timely manner.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1458102341,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/HawkinsHandicrafts?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/073\/0\/11484887\/iusb_760x100.16085161_ex88.jpg","num_favorers":1133,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/11484887\/isla_fullxfull.21321770_9vw36xtr.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":true,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":true,"has_unstructured_policies":true,"custom_shops_state":1,"include_dispute_form_link":false}},{"listing_id":272234704,"state":"active","user_id":65549055,"category_id":68889876,"title":"Men\u2019s Vintage Inspired T-Shirt, Men\u2019s Funny T-Shirt, Quote Clothing for Men, 60th Birthday Gift Idea for men, Born 1957, Unisex t shirt","description":"\u2605\u2605\u2605 Men\u2019s Vintage Inspired T-Shirt, Men\u2019s Funny T-Shirt, Quote Clothing for Men, 60th Birthday Gift Idea for men, Born 1957, Unisex t shirt \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\u2605 CUSTOMIZE FOR ANY YEAR \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\u2605 What to do \u2605\nStep 1 \u2013 decide on the \u201cYEAR\u201d you want \nStep 2 \u2013 Purchase garment from this page \nStep 3 \u2013 Enter the \u201cYEAR\u201d you want, and request what \u201cYEAR\u201d you want in the notes section when you check out.  \n\u2605 Have questions \u2013 just contact us VIA ETYS conversations \u2605\n  \n\u2605 For sizing information please review the sizing chart image within image sections   \n\n\u2605 All orders are \u201ccustom\u201d printed to fulfil individual customer orders using the latest Direct to Garment printing technology.

RARE pillow cut Swarovski crystals in a beautiful custom color are secured to sterling silver posts. The color is stunning & BRAND NEW!! Its a warm copper with an iridescent finish flashing a slight pink golden glimmer! Posts are sterling silver and the setting is your choice: (see last photo) bright copper, oxidized copper, bright silver, oxidized silver, gold or no setting.\r\n(My recommendation for this color crystal is Bright Copper or Gold)\r\n\r\n* Please make sure when you remove these earrings your fingers are securely on the post and you don&#39;t just pull on the crystal. They&#39;re secured with ultra-strong jewelers adhesive but repeated pulling makes them sad!\r\n\r\nThese earrings really pack a punch!!\r\n\r\nI have my own pair and I wear them A LOT.  Extremely comfortable and lightweight!\r\n\r\nLIMITED EDITION!!

This is a great complex scent that smells like whiskey that&#39;s been barrel aged.\n\nLINEN & AIR MIST SPECIFICATIONS:\nThis fragrance mist comes in a 4-ounce frosted glass bottle with fine mist atomizer with cap, and a hand-stamped muslin bag that can be reused. Room mist scents can last for a long time and the strength of the scent will depend on how many sprays, but these will last you quite a while. \n\nWood & Wax, Co&#39;s air mists eliminate odors while leaving behind a light and fresh scent behind. They are naturally milky in colour and separation is normal, so be sure to give it a little shake before each use. Great for freshening up a room quickly, or even as a body spray, too! The ingredients in these mists are not harmful when sprayed onto your body, but if you have very sensitive skin, a patch test in an inconspicuous spot wouldn&#39;t hurt! \n\nThese are fabric-safe, however, if you have a sensitive fabric, try a patch test first. I love to use these on curtains and things I don&#39;t get around to washing as often. It&#39;s great if you can have your windows open and spray a bit on your curtains because the wind will help waft the scent through your house. I like using these mists on my linens and things, also, just to give it a little pick-me-up! Use it to freshen up a pair of shoes you don&#39;t want to throw in the wash, on your pet&#39;s bed, pillows and couches and of course as a regular ol&#39; air freshener.\n\nIf spraying odor eliminator on carpet or furniture, please patch test first. May become slippery on floors. Keep out of reach of children and pets.\n\nLINEN & AIR MIST SHELF LIFE:\n2 years.","creation_tsz":1486653817,"ending_tsz":1497018217,"original_creation_tsz":1436645763,"last_modified_tsz":1486653817,"price":"10.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":14,"tags":["room spray","linen spray","yoga mat spray","deodorizer","natural body mist","room mist","fragrance mist","house spray","home fragrance","spray mist","room fragrance","odor neutralizer","natural room spray"],"category_path":["Housewares","Cleaning"],"category_path_ids":[69150425,69155077],"materials":["atomizer","muslin bag","room spray base","fragrance oil","frosted glass bottle"],"shop_section_id":17506375,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1476333472,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/240051803\/whiskey-oak-linen-air-mist-room-spray?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":114,"num_favorers":7,"shipping_template_id":12766227671,"processing_min":10,"processing_max":15,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"13","item_weight_units":null,"item_length":"7","item_width":"2","item_height":"2","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"unisex_adults","occasion":"housewarming","style":["Boho","Rustic"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":920,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Cleaning Supplies","Air Fresheners"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":1109061439,"hex_code":"A89FA4","red":168,"green":159,"blue":164,"hue":327,"saturation":5,"brightness":65,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1476555076,"listing_id":240051803,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/140\/0\/9696433\/il_75x75.1109061439_6kof.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/140\/0\/9696433\/il_170x135.1109061439_6kof.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/140\/0\/9696433\/il_570xN.1109061439_6kof.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/140\/0\/9696433\/il_fullxfull.1109061439_6kof.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1125},{"listing_image_id":1062482750,"hex_code":"8D8C92","red":141,"green":140,"blue":146,"hue":250,"saturation":4,"brightness":57,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1476555076,"listing_id":240051803,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/9696433\/il_75x75.1062482750_koj0.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/9696433\/il_170x135.1062482750_koj0.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/9696433\/il_570xN.1062482750_koj0.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/9696433\/il_fullxfull.1062482750_koj0.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1125}],"Shop":{"shop_id":9696433,"shop_name":"WoodAndWaxCo","user_id":50232250,"creation_tsz":1404272351,"title":"Natural, handcrafted goods for you + your home.","announcement":"\u2022 FRAGRANCE FAREWELL SALE \u2022 Select fragrances are now MARKED DOWN and RETIRING!

PRODUCTS:\r\nAll products are made to order by hand, variations in the look\/texture of the each item will vary and they are not considered defects or damages, unless completely broken or melted during shipment. Pure, renewable and US grown soy wax is infused with paraben & phthalate-free fragrances. Each candle includes an American Hardwood wooden wick. Wooden wicks are a great alternative to cotton and paper wicks. A wooden wick will increase the scent throw of your candle, as well as provide a slight &quot;firewood&quot; scent. They also make a really amazing crackling sound when lit (don&#39;t be nervous if you hear it!). Always light wooden wicks close to the base of your candle and not at the top. \r\n\r\nUSING YOUR WOODEN WICK CANDLE:\r\nWhen you first light your candles, you should let it burn until it has achieved a full melt pool (liquefied wax that has reached the edges of the container). This will establish the memory burn and will help keep the scent in your candle strong and your wax from tunneling. Your initial burn is very important, but you should let your candle reach a full melt pool each time after, as well. Burn times will vary, burn time is an approximate. If you are experiencing problems with your wood wick not staying lit, the solution is simple! It just needs to be trimmed a bit. To trim it, make sure the wax is firm and cool to the touch, then use your fingers to pinch off the burnt top of the wick.\r\n\r\nOTHER INFORMATION:\r\nDuring the hotter months, shipping your items may take place during the beginning of the week (Monday-Wednesday) to help ensure that your products are delivered to you in their intended state and not in a melty mess!

This tank top fits great, feels great, and is flowy - Throw in the extreme softness of the tri-blend material and you have a tank top that can\u2019t be beat! \n\nAll of our tops are printed through a process called \u2018Direct To Garment\u2019 printing. DTG printing results in a very subtly faded \u2018vintage\u2019 style print when printed onto our tri-blend tops. Because our tank tops are so soft, we use this style of printing to give a subtle vintage look that doesn\u2019t weigh the shirt down. It\u2019s the perfect combo with our tri-blend tops!\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSize Guide (Unisex sizes and conversion to women&#39;s sizes):\n\nXS - US Size 0 (12.5\u201d Chest Width - 28&quot; - 30\u201d Bust) (16.5\u201d Length)\nS - US Size 0-2 (13.5\u201d Chest Width - 30&quot; - 32\u201d Bust) (17\u201d Length)\nM - US Size 4-6 (14\u201d Chest Width - 32&quot; - 34\u201d Bust) (18\u201d Length)\nL - US Size 8-10 (16\u201d Chest Width - 36&quot; - 38\u201d Bust) (18.5\u201d Length)\n*XL - Available in this design, which is our Athletic Tank Top, with a longer length - US Size 12-14 (19\u201d Chest Width - 39&quot; - 41&quot; Bust) (29\u201d Length)\n\nAn in-depth size guide & description is available in the images above.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nShipping:\n\nAll our shirts are made per order with a completion time of 2-7 days from ordering to print (it&#39;s usually 3-5 days or less.)\n\nThe estimated shipping times after printing completion are:\n\nUnited States: 3-5 business days, $6.99 USD\n\nCanada: 5-8 Business Days, $10.99 USD\n\nEverywhere Else In The World, $11.99 USD\n\nWe also offer USPS Priority Shipping & FedEx 2-Day Shipping in the U.S.!\n\n(Shipping prices above are based on orders of one item.
